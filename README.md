# DeepLearning
In this project, we will tackle a multi-class classification problem using the Stanford Dogs dataset. 
This dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world, where we have unbalanced number of image data for each class. However, the dataset are not extremely imbalanced, the number of images per class range between 150 to 200. There are 20580 images of different sizes in total. 
This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. 
It was originally collected for fine-grain image categorization, a challenging problem as certain dog breeds have near identical features or differ in color and age.
